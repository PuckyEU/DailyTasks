### Overview
This lightweight task-repeating Android application is designed to help users keep track of their daily tasks and activities without any unnecessary clutter. 
The application automatically unchecks completed tasks the next day, making it easy for users to manage their to-do list on a daily basis.

One of the key benefits of this application is that all the data is stored locally, ensuring user privacy and security. 
The app is also very simple and easy to use, with a minimalistic interface that doesn't require any complex setup or configuration.

Although it is similar to my other repository [**Repeaty**](https://github.com/PuckyEU/habit-manager),
I have slightly different plans and goals for it. [**Repeaty**](https://github.com/PuckyEU/habit-manager) was more on the habit building side,
this is more on the to-do list side.

### Download
You can download TaskLooper from the [**Google Play Store**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=lukas.sobotik.tasklooper) or the APK from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/PuckyEU/TaskLooper/releases) section.
