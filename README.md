### Overview
Although it is similar to my other repository [**Repeaty**](https://github.com/PuckyEU/habit-manager),
I have slightly different plans and goals for it. [**Repeaty**](https://github.com/PuckyEU/habit-manager) was more on the habit building side,
this is more on the to-do list side. 

I have plans to add more complex checklists, meaning they will automatically detect if you have done them already. 
One of the will be "Daily Commit", which will check if you have committed that day on GitHub.
